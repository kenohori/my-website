			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>
				I am a postdoc researcher at the <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/">3D geoinformation</a> group of the <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a> in the Netherlands.
				I am also the secretary of the ISPRS <a href="http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/wg1.html">working group IV/1</a> on Multi-dimensional modelling.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main focus of my research is higher-dimensional (4D and higher) data models, data structures and algorithms for Geographic Information Systems, using these dimensions to model not only space, but also other characteristics such as time and scale.
				However, I also work on other topics that combine geometric or topological computing with spatial information, such as geometric modelling and processing, the validation and repair of geographic data, and visualising spatial data.
				I like theoretical work, but what I enjoy most is implementing my ideas into working prototypes and, when they are serious enough, into <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/code/">free software</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apart from my work, I am passionate about travelling and learning about the world, as well as about the arts, science and technology.
				I strongly believe in free, tolerant and diverse societies, and I support all sorts of progressive politics, especially when these relate to human rights and privacy, science and technology, and the internet.
				I like simple things done well, and many other things including photography, languages, trains and public transport, typography, progressive rock, jazz and classical music.
